# Contacts App

I built this project to dive into the basics of backend development using JavaScript.

## What I Learned

- Followed the MVC pattern to organize my code neatly.
- Set up CRUD operations using Express-Handlebars and Bootstrap to make the frontend dynamic and user-friendly.
- Used MySQL as the relational database management system to store and manage application data.
- Made authentication work with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and cookies, and hashed passwords using bcrypt to keep things secure.
- Created a middleware to check if users are who they say they are.
- Dockerized everything—my Node.js app, MySQL database, and PHPMyAdmin—so running them together is a breeze.
